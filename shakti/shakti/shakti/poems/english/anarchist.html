Deep rumblings ashore  
"Whose corpse floats on the river?  
Where was his home?" 
Night waves only rumble:  
"It's I, the anarchist".   

Does ocean embrace living and the dead 
Both so dear?   

Who knows if hemlock is the right drink,  
Elixir is poison? 
Intellect tires by day and night.   

Deep rumblings ashore  
"Whose corpse floats on the river?  
Where was his home?" 
Night waves only rumble:  
"It's I, the anarchist".
