Still kept your favorite key   
The one, that got lost? 
How do you open the vault now?   

Still have that spot on your chin? 
Sudden urge to write 
Before journey begins to a new land   

Kept the key with utmost care 
For all theseyears 
"Do you want it back?
Please let me know."

Your luminous face 
Awash with tears 
In memories' attic 
"Do you want it back? 
Please let me know."
