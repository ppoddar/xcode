Thinking  
It's time to turn back  

So much dirt in these hands  
Over so many years  
Never thought of you as you    

Now next to a ravine in the night  
The moon beckon: "Come, Come, Come"

Standing on Ganga's bank, sleepy  
The pyre beckons: "Come, Come"

I may go  
Whichever way  
But why?    

Would rather hold my child
Kiss her face    

Will go  
But not now

Will take all of you  
Won't go   
All of a sudden,  
Alone.
