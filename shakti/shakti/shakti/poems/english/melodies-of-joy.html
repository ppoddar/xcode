Wilted frame in the room
Unlike that twilight of monsoon
Rain soaked flowers in the garden
Melodies of Joy. 

The boy no more came to the greens
The banyan no more wept on his flute
Still lightning sparks
'midst thunderclouds

Hadn't she known
Moments like this
Grabs the rooster's comb?
Hadn't she known
Waste of heart, is never to be?

Hadn't she known
This gift of gab
Is not as deep as my heart?
Hadn't she known
No one knew her as deep as I?  

Wilted frame in the room
Unlike that twilight of monsoon
Rain soaked flowers in the garden
Melodies of Joy.
