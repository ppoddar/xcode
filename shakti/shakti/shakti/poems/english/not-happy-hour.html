Body trembles from head to toe  
Wall meets wall, cornice to cornice 
Pavement swaps at midnight   

Time to return home 
Home inside home, feet inside feet, heart inside heart 
Nothing more...or something more than that?   

Body trembles from head to toe  
Wall meets wall, cornice to cornice 
Pavement swaps at midnight   

Time to return home 
Home inside home, feet inside feet, heart inside heart 
Nothing more.   

"Hands Up!" lift your hands
Till someone picks you up 
Inside a black van 
Black van inside black van, inside bigger van 
Windows, doors and graves in rows... 
Haphazard skeletons   

White mite inside skeleton 
Life inside mite 
Death inside life -- hence 
Death inside death 
Nothing more.   

"Hands Up!": lift your hand
Till someone throws you off a van 
But inside a bigger van 
Where someone waits, always 
Grips tight as saplings on concrete  
Someone unknown 
Waits with garland in hand 
Like a flower inside a hard bud 
As spider's golden web 
She will garland you 
Your wedding is at midnight 
When pavement swaps, body trembles from head to toe 
Wall meets wall, cornice to cornice   

Imagine carriages standing still, stations running 
Imagine shoes walking, feet are still 
Imagine the craziest things 
Babies carrying corpses, rushing to pyre 
Deceased waltzing across river of death.   

That was not happy hour, not moment of joy 
Body trembles from head to toe 
Wall meets wall, cornice to cornice 
Pavement swaps at midnight   

Hour of coming home 
Home inside home, feet inside feet, heart inside heart 
Nothing more...
