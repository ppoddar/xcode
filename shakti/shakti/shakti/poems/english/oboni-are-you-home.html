Neighborhood asleep  
Doors shut tight 
Night's sudden knock: 
"Oboni, are you home?"   

Pours here 'round the year 
Cattle clouds roam 
Dejected tall green grass 
Grabs the door 
"Oboni, are you home?"   

Faint pain laten in my heart 
I drowse.  
Sudden knock of the dark: 
"Oboni, are you home?"
