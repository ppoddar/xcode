Seen many postmen wander in the forest of Fall 
Their yellow bags filled like bovine bellies 
Picked up letters of yore, old and new  
Those men in the forest of fall   
  

Seen them ceaseless 
As egrets fish 
Mysterious, alert, agile   
Not like postmen of our days 
Not like hands that lose letters of our luxurious love   

We are drifting apart 
Going afar for lure of letters 
Getting more letters from far 
Going away from you yesterday  
To post love letters today 
Thus we drift away from our kin 
Reveal our foolish weakness and greed   

We no more reflect in a mirror 
We float away in loneliness of our balconies  
We are floating away bare in moonshine 
Long have we not held each other in arms 
Long have we not kissed each other 
Long have we not heard other sing 
Long have we not seen a carefree kid 
We are walking towards a forest older than the woods 
Where the eternal leaves left their marks on the rocks 
We are heading to a world void of contact    

Seen many postmen in the forest of Fall 
Their yellow bags filled like bovine bellies 
Picked up old letters anew  
Those men in the forest of fall   
  
A letter drifts apart from a letter 
Never seen a tree movinging away from a tree.
