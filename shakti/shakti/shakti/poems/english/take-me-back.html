Why have you bring me in?
Take me back.

Let me return
This face cold as dark, miser eyes sad as dry lake
Touching her hand

No more on this arid land
Feet bloodied with splinters
Why did you usher me in?
Crushing bed of straws?
Take me back.

Smell of rotten crop, green moss,
Of tri-eyed sardines
All my dark senses
Are in spicerack of your kitchen

I see no hand or feet of limbless night
Where have you brought me in your decay?
I see no hand or feet of limbless night.

Soft wind blows, ocean must be close
You tie me up in wrinkled grip
As if I approach the shore with all my dark
The sea will recede, cold will recede,
Death will recede
Then you might borne Death for Life
Dark I am, Dark I will, or Dark I'll become

Why have you bring me in?
Take me back.
